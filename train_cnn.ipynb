    "In this notebook we will train together your first CNN. Both the problem and the network we will use to solve it are very old: they were introduced in the late 1980s at the very start of deep learning litterature. The dataset is composed of handwritten digits which we will identify as 0s, 1s, 2, etc... It is called MNIST. Nowadays, this task is considered too simple to truly evaluate the power of a deep learning model. Even though the deep learning community still uses this dataset, performing well on MNIST is considered a proof of concept, or even a sanity check, rather than really an achievement. Still, it will make for a good sandbox to present CNNs, their architectures, their building blocks and good practices (and of course a lot of technical _jargon_).\n",
